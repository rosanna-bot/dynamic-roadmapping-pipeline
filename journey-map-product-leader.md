> **Dynamic Roadmapping Product — Product Leader Journey**
> **Date**: February 2026

---

## Persona Overview

**Name**: AADHYA — Product Leader
**Role**: VP of Product / Head of Product / Director of Product Management
**Goal**: Align a portfolio of products with company strategy, ensure teams are building the right things, and make fast portfolio-level decisions grounded in evidence rather than opinion.

### Context

AADHYA manages a portfolio of 3–8 product areas, each owned by a Product Manager. She reports to the CPO or CEO and is accountable for ensuring the product organization delivers on company strategy. Her daily work involves balancing strategic direction-setting with tactical unblocking, stakeholder alignment, and cross-team coordination.

### Key Characteristics

- Needs **portfolio-level visibility** — not just individual product roadmaps
- Operates at the **strategic theme** level, not epic or story level
- Primary interactions are with **executives, PMs, and cross-functional leaders**
- Success measured by **strategy execution, revenue impact, and team velocity**
- Time is her scarcest resource — every interaction must be high-signal

## Journey Map

### Phase 1: Strategy Definition

#### Current State (Pain)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Activities** | Translates company vision into product strategy; defines OKRs for the product organization; creates strategic planning documents |
| **Tools Used** | Google Slides, spreadsheets, Aha!, Notion — disconnected from execution tools |
| **Key Pain** | Strategy and goals live in static documents with no live connection to what teams are actually building. Strategic intent gets lost in translation — teams interpret goals differently without a shared, connected system. |
| **Emotional State** | Frustrated — spends significant effort on strategy articulation, but can't verify whether it's being followed |
| **Frequency** | Quarterly strategy cycles with ad-hoc adjustments |
| **Workarounds** | Manual check-ins with each PM to verify alignment; separate "strategy on a page" decks maintained alongside execution tools |

#### Future State (Dynamic Roadmap Vision)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Experience** | Goals and OKRs defined directly in Miro, linked to portfolios and initiatives at every level |
| **AI Role** | AI validates alignment in real-time, flagging when proposed work doesn't connect to active strategic objectives. Proactively alerts: "Initiative X has no connection to any active Q2 goal — consider re-evaluating or creating a new goal." |
| **Key Benefit** | Strategy becomes a living, connected artifact — not a static document. Changes propagate automatically and alignment is continuously verified. |
| **Impact** | Reduces strategy-execution gap; eliminates "lost in translation" risk; gives leaders confidence that teams are working on the right things |

### Phase 2: Portfolio Oversight

#### Current State (Pain)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Activities** | Reviews status of all product areas; identifies cross-team overlaps and gaps; allocates resources across initiatives |
| **Tools Used** | Individual Miro boards per PM, Jira dashboards, manual aggregation in spreadsheets |
| **Key Pain** | No shared visibility across products and teams. Each PM uses tools independently. Leaders must manually aggregate views across disparate boards, tools, and spreadsheets to form a portfolio picture. |
| **Emotional State** | Overwhelmed — the effort to get a portfolio view is disproportionate to the value; information is always incomplete |
| **Frequency** | Weekly leadership reviews; daily ad-hoc checks |
| **Workarounds** | Asks each PM to submit a weekly status update; manually creates a portfolio spreadsheet; uses Slack to chase updates |

**Customer Quote**:
> "Each product manager currently uses Miro independently... we lack shared visibility across products and teams, which is why the Miro portfolio functionality looks promising."

#### Future State (Dynamic Roadmap Vision)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Experience** | Unified portfolio view in Miro Spaces showing all product roadmaps with health signals, goal alignment scores, and delivery status. One-click drill-down from portfolio to individual roadmap to epic. |
| **AI Role** | AI aggregates health signals across teams and surfaces anomalies: "Team Alpha's roadmap coverage of Goal 3 dropped from 40% to 15% after last week's re-prioritization." |
| **Key Benefit** | Single pane of glass for the entire product portfolio — always current, always complete |
| **Impact** | Saves 3–5 hours per week in manual aggregation; eliminates blind spots; enables proactive rather than reactive portfolio management |

---

### Phase 3: Decision Making

#### Current State (Pain)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Activities** | Makes prioritization calls across product areas; resolves resource conflicts; approves or redirects initiative scope |
| **Tools Used** | Meetings, Slack debates, spreadsheet-based prioritization frameworks |
| **Key Pain** | Leadership over-involvement in tactical decisions; last-minute scope changes driven by opinions (HiPPO dynamics) rather than evidence. This undermines roadmap integrity and erodes team trust. |
| **Emotional State** | Conflicted — wants to empower PMs but feels compelled to intervene when visibility is poor |
| **Frequency** | Multiple times per week, often in unstructured contexts |
| **Workarounds** | Holds extra 1:1s with PMs; requests ad-hoc analysis before making decisions; defaults to the loudest voice in the room when data isn't available |

#### Future State (Dynamic Roadmap Vision)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Experience** | Evidence-based decision support surfaced proactively. Leaders see customer evidence, execution reality, and strategic alignment for every initiative they're evaluating. |
| **AI Role** | AI proactively surfaces decision-ready intelligence: "Customer churn signal in Segment X aligns with Initiative Y — recommend re-prioritizing. Here's the evidence: 8 accounts, $1.2M ARR, 23 feedback items in last 60 days." |
| **Key Benefit** | Decisions are faster, more defensible, and grounded in evidence — reducing HiPPO dynamics and increasing team trust in leadership |
| **Impact** | Reduces decision cycle time by 50%+; improves decision quality; empowers PMs to execute with confidence |

### Phase 4: Stakeholder Alignment

#### Current State (Pain)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Activities** | Prepares roadmap views for board meetings, executive reviews, sales kick-offs, engineering planning; responds to ad-hoc requests from sales, CS, and executives |
| **Tools Used** | PowerPoint/Google Slides, manually curated Miro boards, email updates |
| **Key Pain** | Teams spend hours manually customizing roadmap views for different stakeholders. Each audience needs a different level of detail and framing. Risk of version drift between different presentation layers. |
| **Emotional State** | Exhausted — communication overhead is significant and feels like low-value work |
| **Frequency** | Weekly for internal; monthly for executive; quarterly for board |
| **Workarounds** | Maintains 3–4 separate roadmap versions; dedicates a PM's time to "roadmap communications"; manually reconciles when versions drift |

#### Future State (Dynamic Roadmap Vision)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Experience** | Auto-generated views for every audience — executive summary, team detail, customer-facing — all derived from one underlying data source. Each view updates automatically as the roadmap evolves. |
| **AI Role** | AI generates audience-appropriate summaries: "For tomorrow's board meeting, here's a 3-slide summary of Q1 progress, top risks, and key decisions needed." |
| **Key Benefit** | Eliminates manual view creation; ensures all stakeholders see consistent, current information; recovers hours of PM and leader time |
| **Impact** | Saves 5–10 hours per month in presentation preparation; eliminates version drift risk; improves stakeholder satisfaction with communication quality |

---

### Phase 5: Progress Tracking

#### Current State (Pain)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Activities** | Tracks execution progress across teams; identifies delays and blockers; reports status to executive leadership |
| **Tools Used** | Jira dashboards (per team), manual status reports from PMs, spreadsheet trackers |
| **Key Pain** | Cannot understand if execution is on track. Relies on manual status reports from individual PMs. Information is always stale by the time it reaches leadership — surprises emerge too late to course-correct. |
| **Emotional State** | Anxious — feels like flying blind; never confident that the picture is accurate |
| **Frequency** | Weekly tracking cadence; daily for at-risk initiatives |
| **Workarounds** | Requires PMs to send weekly written updates; joins team standups to get direct information; creates escalation protocols for late-breaking issues |

#### Future State (Dynamic Roadmap Vision)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Experience** | Real-time delivery signals from Jira/Azure DevOps feed directly into the portfolio dashboard. Status is always current, always accurate. |
| **AI Role** | AI flags risks and delays proactively: "Team Alpha's velocity dropped 25% over the last 3 sprints — Q2 deliverable for Initiative X is at risk. Recommended action: scope reduction or timeline adjustment." |
| **Key Benefit** | Leaders see execution reality in real-time; risks are surfaced before they become crises; no more manual status aggregation |
| **Impact** | Eliminates 2–3 hours per week of status gathering; enables proactive risk mitigation; improves on-time delivery rates |

---

### Phase 6: Strategy Pivots

#### Current State (Pain)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Activities** | Responds to market changes, executive mandates, or customer crises by adjusting product strategy; cascades changes across teams |
| **Tools Used** | Ad-hoc meetings, updated slide decks, Slack communications, manual Jira re-planning |
| **Key Pain** | Shifting product strategy requires cascading changes across multiple tools and teams. Impact analysis is manual and incomplete. Leaders can't see downstream effects of strategic pivots. |
| **Emotional State** | Stressed — pivots feel high-risk because the blast radius is unknown |
| **Frequency** | 2–4 times per year for major pivots; monthly for smaller adjustments |
| **Workarounds** | Holds war-room sessions to manually trace impact; asks each PM to assess impact independently; accepts that some downstream effects will be missed |

#### Future State (Dynamic Roadmap Vision)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Experience** | Before committing to a pivot, leaders can simulate the impact across the portfolio. The system shows cascading effects on timelines, dependencies, customer commitments, and team capacity. |
| **AI Role** | AI simulates strategy changes: "Shifting 30% of resources from Area A to Area B would: delay Initiatives X and Y by 6 weeks, affect 12 customer commitments ($3.2M ARR), but accelerate Goal 3 coverage by 40%." Auto-proposes roadmap adjustments with trade-off analysis. |
| **Key Benefit** | Pivots become data-driven decisions with full visibility into consequences; reduces risk of unintended downstream effects |
| **Impact** | Reduces pivot execution time from weeks to days; minimizes customer disruption; improves leadership confidence in strategic changes |

## Key Product Leader Pain Points (Cross-Phase)

1. **Shifting product strategy** — leadership over-involvement, last-minute scope changes driven by opinions rather than evidence
2. **Inability to delegate effectively** — struggle to empower product leaders to own pace, problem-solve, and communicate without escalation
3. **Poor cross-functional alignment** — miscommunication, delays, and constant context-switching between product, engineering, and design
4. **Manual view customization** — teams must manually customize roadmap views for different stakeholders (executives need strategy, engineers need details)
