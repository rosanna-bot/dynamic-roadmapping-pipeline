# Dynamic Roadmapping V1 — Kick-Off

---

## The Problem

**Product Managers are drowning in manual work instead of making strategic decisions.**

Today, a PM's roadmapping workflow looks like this:

- **Customer feedback** lives in Gong, Salesforce, Zendesk — disconnected from the roadmap
- **Execution status** lives in Jira — disconnected from the roadmap
- **Strategy documents** live in slides and spreadsheets — disconnected from execution
- **The PM is the manual integration layer**, spending 4–6 hours per week gathering signals instead of acting on them

The result? Roadmaps are stale within days of creation. Prioritization decisions feel arbitrary. And when leadership asks "why are we building this?" — the evidence trail doesn't exist.

### The numbers tell the story

| Signal | Data |
|---|---|
| **60%** of Miro customers already use us for roadmapping | Massive organic demand — but we're not serving them well |
| **Only 34%** are very satisfied | Highest frustration score across all agile use cases |
| **Only 9.7%** are very satisfied with their current solution | Nearly everyone is underserved |
| **$2.7M ARR** in customers explicitly telling us we're not good enough | Revenue at risk — and a mandate to act |
| **44%** say no tool gives them the visualization they need | The #1 pain point from our solution review |

> *"We have a general lack of data to support product decisions and want AI to speed up PRD generation, feature alignment, and prioritization."*
> — Enterprise customer feedback

---

## The Opportunity

**A $1B+ addressable market — and we're uniquely positioned to win it.**

No competitor combines what Miro already has:

| Miro Asset | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **Visual collaboration on an infinite canvas** | Teams already love and use Miro daily — it's where the work happens |
| **Two-way Jira integration** | Users with Jira connected have **4x the active days/month** |
| **Miro Insights (AI engine)** | Customer intelligence from Gong, Salesforce, Zendesk, NPS — all in one place |
| **Timeline, Tables, Kanban** | Building blocks that can be unified into a coherent roadmapping system |
| **Unstructured + structured in one place** | No pure PM tool can combine whiteboarding, workshops, and structured planning |

### Competitive timing is on our side

- **Productboard is deprecating legacy ARR boards** — their customers are actively evaluating alternatives, including Miro
- **Aha! and JPD** are rigid and non-collaborative — the market wants visual freedom
- **AI-first roadmapping** is emerging but nobody has cracked it at scale yet

> *"ProductBoard is deprecating the old ARR boards... we need to test this critically and look at competitive offerings like Miro Insights."*
> — Enterprise customer evaluating alternatives

---

## Persona & Pain Points We're Addressing

### Primary Persona: Product Manager

The PM who builds and maintains roadmaps, prioritizes features, and communicates plans — but spends more time gathering data than making decisions.

| Pain Point | Severity | What They Tell Us |
|---|---|---|
| **Decision traceability** — Can't trace decisions back to customer evidence | Critical | "Prioritization feels arbitrary and hard to defend" |
| **Roadmap currency** — Roadmap is stale within days of creation | Critical | Constant manual maintenance erodes productivity |
| **Real-time visibility** — No live view of delivery status | High | Information is always stale by the time stakeholders see it |
| **Manual signal gathering** — 4–6 hrs/week collecting feedback manually | High | Critical signals are missed or arrive too late |
| **Idea validation** — No quantified demand per backlog item | High | Can't answer "how many customers want this?" |
| **Ad-hoc reporting** — Constant interruptions for status updates | Medium | PM becomes a human reporting API |

### Secondary Persona: Product Leader

The leader who oversees a portfolio, ensures strategic alignment, and needs fast evidence-based decisions.

| Pain Point | Severity | What They Tell Us |
|---|---|---|
| **No single pane of glass** — Must manually aggregate views across tools | Critical | "We lack shared visibility across products and teams" |
| **HiPPO-driven decisions** — Opinions override evidence | High | Leadership over-involvement, last-minute scope changes |
| **Manual view customization** — Different versions for every audience | High | Hours spent reformatting; risk of version drift |
| **Flying blind on delivery** — Relies on stale manual status reports | High | Surprises emerge too late to course-correct |

## Why This Matters

### For customers
The PM's role is being squeezed. AI is saving ~2 hours/day on routine tasks (docs, meeting summaries), but **strategic work — prioritization, customer empathy, market analysis — remains underserved**. 84% of PMs fear their products will fail. We can change that equation.

### For Miro
This is a **land-and-expand play** at the heart of the product development workflow:

- **Retention**: Solve roadmapping and customers have a reason to stay in Miro every single day — not just for workshops
- **Expansion**: Roadmapping touches every PM, every product leader, and every stakeholder who consumes the roadmap
- **Differentiation**: No competitor can combine visual collaboration + Jira execution data + AI customer insights on one canvas
- **Revenue protection**: $2.7M ARR in customers who are telling us directly that Miro isn't good enough today

### For the market
The $1B+ roadmapping and portfolio management TAM is being reshaped by AI. The vendor who connects customer evidence → prioritization → execution tracking → stakeholder communication into one seamless loop will own this space. That vendor should be Miro.

## Why Now

| Driver | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Competitive window** | Productboard deprecating legacy boards; customers actively evaluating Miro. Window is open now — it won't stay open. |
| **Building blocks exist** | Timeline (Agile WACU doubled this year), Tables, Kanban, Insights, Jira sync, AI Sidekick — the foundation is built. We're not starting from scratch. |
| **Customer pull is undeniable** | 60% already use us for roadmapping; $2.7M ARR in vocal dissatisfaction; E.ON, Ubisoft, PWC, Keyloop, Fidelity all have active roadmapping needs. |
| **AI maturity** | Miro Insights is live, AI Sidekick is live, inference infrastructure exists. We can power intelligence features on day one. |
| **Agentic AI moment** | 85% of companies expect to customize autonomous agents within 12–18 months. If we build the roadmapping intelligence layer now, we ride this wave — not chase it. |
| **Internal momentum** | Strategy Pack, Insights × Tables enrichment, and Timeline improvements are all converging. This is the moment to unify them into one coherent product. |

| Jira-connected users = 4x active days/month | Engagement data |
| Kanban = highest multi-day engagement (9.1%) | Product analytics |

### Qualitative evidence

| Signal | Source |
|---|---|
| E.ON: Want Jira epic fields displayed in timeline with dates | SFDC / Deal room |
| Ubisoft: "This is exactly what they need" (timeline for roadmapping) | Customer feedback |
| Multiple accounts: Actively evaluating Miro as Productboard replacement | Gong / SFDC |
| 200+ mentions of grouping/hierarchy as top Timeline pain point | CSAT feedback |
| 44% of respondents lack a tool for the visualization they need | Solution review |
| 23% can't connect to company goals | Solution review |

### Market validation

- Productboard deprecating legacy features — customers in active transition
- Airfocus, Zeda.io emerging with AI prioritization but lacking enterprise scale
- 85% of companies expect to deploy autonomous agents within 18 months

## How We're Prioritising: Customer Insights Driving the Backlog

We're using a **multi-signal prioritisation model** to decide what to build first, not gut feel:

### Signal 1: Customer Pain Frequency (from Solution Review & CSAT)

| Pain Point | % of Respondents | Implication for V1 |
|---|---|---|
| No tool for the visualisation they need | **44%** | → Preconfigured space with connected views (Table, Timeline, Kanban) |
| Cannot connect to company goals | **23%** | → Signals section + Pulse with strategic context (V1); Goal alignment (V2) |
| Need a tool stakeholders will engage with | **13%** | → Dedicated entry point, polished UX, shareable views |
| Cannot understand if on track | **12%** | → Jira sync + execution snapshot + risk indicators |

### Signal 2: Feature Request Volume (from CSAT & Feedback)

| Request | Volume | V1 Response |
|---|---|---|
| Grouping & hierarchy in timeline | **200+ mentions** | → Table + Timeline + Kanban unified views with structured data |
| Customisation (tagging, time scales, styling) | High | → Configurable views, filter panel, ICE scoring |
| Sync control ("don't change Jira when I present") | Medium | → Snapshot mode scoped for V2; read-only presentation view considered |

### Signal 3: Revenue Signal (from SFDC & Deal Rooms)

- **$2.7M ARR** in customers explicitly requesting better roadmapping
- Named accounts (E.ON, Ubisoft, PWC, Keyloop, Fidelity) with active needs
- Productboard migration candidates evaluating Miro Insights as replacement

### Signal 4: Engagement Data (from Product Analytics)

- Jira-connected users = **4x active days** → Prioritise Jira integration in V1
- Kanban = **9.1% multi-day engagement** (highest) → Include Kanban as a core view
- Timeline + Kanban used **in parallel** → Unified views with synced content are essential

### Prioritisation outcome → V1 focuses on the three highest-impact moves:

| V1 Pillar | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Dedicated entry point** | Reduce friction to start; make roadmapping a first-class Miro workflow |
| **Preconfigured space** | Eliminate "blank canvas" paralysis; instant time-to-value with connected views, Pulse, and Signals |
| **Brownfield onboarding** | Meet users where they are — connect Jira projects, Insights, and existing boards rather than starting from zero |

## From V0 to V1: Solving Pain Points Progressively

### V0 — What Exists Today (Foundation)

The building blocks are live but disconnected:

| V0 Component | Status | Pain Points Addressed |
|---|---|---|
| **Timeline widget** | Live (WACU doubled) | Partial: Gives PMs a visual roadmap format — but 44% still say no tool gives them the visualization they need (limited grouping, customisation, hierarchy) |
| **Tables + Kanban** | Live | Partial: Structured data + highest engagement view — but disconnected from Timeline and Insights |
| **Miro Insights** | Live | Partial: AI-powered customer feedback clustering — but disconnected from Tables/Timeline; insights don't flow into the roadmap |
| **Jira two-way sync** | Live (basic) | Partial: Execution data connected — but status only, no epic-level richness in timeline |
| **AI Sidekick** | Live | Partial: On-demand roadmap analysis — but reactive, not proactive |

**V0's core limitation:** Every piece exists, but they're **islands**. The PM is still the manual integration layer stitching them together.

### V1 — Dynamic Roadmap (Unified System)

V1 connects the islands into one coherent product:

| V1 Solution | Pain Points Solved | How It Connects to V0 |
|---|---|---|
| **Dedicated entry point** (Create Product Roadmap from Spaces) | **Discoverability** — PMs don't know Miro can be their roadmapping tool; roadmapping isn't a first-class workflow today | Surfaces the existing building blocks (Timeline, Tables, Kanban) through a clear, intentional entry point |
| **Preconfigured space** (Pulse + Plan + Signals structure) | **"Blank canvas" paralysis** — 44% lack a tool for the visualization they need; PMs don't know where to start | Unifies Timeline, Tables, Kanban, and Insights into a structured space with purpose-built navigation |
| **Brownfield onboarding** (AI-guided connection of existing data) | **Manual signal gathering** (4–6 hrs/week); **Decision traceability** (can't link evidence to decisions); **Roadmap currency** (stale within days) | Connects Jira (execution data), Insights (customer evidence), strategy docs, and analytics — turns V0 islands into a connected system |

### Pain Point Resolution Map

| PM Pain Point | V0 Status | V1 Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| **Decision traceability** — can't trace decisions to customer evidence | Insights exists but disconnected from roadmap | Customer-enriched backlog: every item shows # customers, ARR, quotes. Customer Signals tab in detail panel. |
| **Roadmap currency** — stale within days | Timeline/Tables exist but manually maintained | Jira two-way sync auto-updates status. Insights enrichment auto-refreshes. Pulse surfaces changes proactively. |
| **Real-time visibility** — info always stale | Jira sync exists but basic | Execution Snapshot in Pulse. Risk indicators on Timeline. Roadmap Health card. |
| **Manual signal gathering** — 4-6 hrs/week | Insights clusters feedback but PM must go find it | Pulse surfaces top signals daily. Customer Signals tab on every item. AI-curated "Suggested Actions." |
| **Idea validation** — no quantified demand | No connection between feedback and backlog | Enriched columns: # Mentions, Est. Revenue, Company Names. Ideas Backlog with same enrichment. |
| **No single visualization tool** (44%) | Timeline, Tables, Kanban exist separately | Unified views in one space — Table (plan), Timeline (present), Kanban (track) — all synced |
| **Can't connect to company goals** (23%) | No goal linkage | Strategy docs connected during onboarding; Pulse references strategic context. Full goal alignment in V2. |

## The Vision We're Building Toward

> Build a dynamic, AI-first roadmapping system where proactive intelligence — drawn from customer signals, execution data, market context, and strategic goals — continuously surfaces actionable decisions that keep product roadmaps aligned with reality and company strategy.

**V1 is the foundation.** We connect the islands, give PMs evidence at their fingertips, and prove the value of proactive intelligence.

**V2 extends to leaders and the portfolio.** Alignment scoring, scenario planning, dependency intelligence, and autonomous agents.

**The destination:** A system where the roadmap is never stale, every decision has a traceable evidence trail, and AI doesn't just assist — it anticipates.
